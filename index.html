    <p>I am a first year mathematics PhD student at Princeton University. My graduate studies are supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship program. Thanks NSF!</p>
    <p>I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago. At Chicago, <a href="https://math.uchicago.edu/~emerton/" style="color: #458588;">Matt Emerton</a> and Sasha Beilinson very generously taught me most of the math I know. I will forever be grateful to them.</p>
    <p>My research interests are in algebraic geometry, number theory, and singularities.</p>

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>Thanks to the generous support of Princeton and the NSF, I have not yet had to teach at Princeton.</p>
    <p>As an undergrad at Chicago, I was a TA twice for math 112, a course teaching elementary number theory (and an introduction to proofs) aimed at humanities students. I also volunteered on occasion for the <a href="https://www.mathcirclesofchicago.org">Math Circles of Chicago</a>.</p>
    <p>I was a mentor for the <a href="https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2024/">Chicago REU in 2024</a>. As a student, I participated in the REU three times, and had a blast each time -- thanks to <a href="http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/">Peter May</a> for organizing it, and <a href="https://niemiro.dev">Matthew Niemiro</a> for making my participation much more pleasant.</p>

    <p>My favorite books are Sally's Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis, <i>The God of Small Things</i> by Arundhati Roy, and <i>The Dream of Scipio</i> by Iain Pears (<i>not the one by Cicero!</i>); and I also love the music of Phillip Glass. I once tried to understand art history research, and while I never got far, I always loved this quote by John Ruskin: "Now -- pardon me for telling you frankly -- you cannot have good architecture merely by asking people's advice on occasion. All good architecture is the expression of national life and character; and it is produced by a prevalent and eager national taste, or desire for beauty." I hope that I contribute to the mathematical nation's desire for beauty.</p>
