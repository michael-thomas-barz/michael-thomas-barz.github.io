      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a mathematics PhD student at Princeton University. My graduate studies are supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program. Thank you NSF! </p>
      <p>I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago; I graduated from Chicago in June 2024. At Chicago, Matt Emerton and Sasha Beilinson taught me many exciting things; I am very grateful for their help. </p>
