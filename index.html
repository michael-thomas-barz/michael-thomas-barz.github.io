    <p>I am a first year mathematics PhD student at Princeton University. My graduate studies are supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship program. Thanks NSF!</p>
    <p>I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago. At Chicago, <a href="https://math.uchicago.edu/~emerton/" style="color: #458588;">Matt Emerton</a> and Sasha Beilinson very generously taught me most of the math I know. I will forever be grateful to them.</p>
    <p>My research interests are in algebraic geometry, number theory, and singularities.</p>
    <p>My favorite books are Sally's Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis, The God of Small Things, and The Dream of Scipio; and I also love the music of Phillip Glass. I once tried to understand art history research, and while I never got far, I always loved this quote by John Ruskin: "Now -- pardon me for telling you frankly -- you cannot have good architecture merely by asking people's advice on occasion. All good architecture is the expression of national life and character; and it is produced by a prevalent and eager national taste, or desire for beauty." I hope that I'll be contributing to the mathematical nation's desire for beauty.</p>
