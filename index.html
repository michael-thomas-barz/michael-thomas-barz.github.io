    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a first year mathematics PhD student at <a href="https://www.math.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>. My graduate studies are supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship program. Thanks NSF!</p>
    <p>My research interests are in algebraic geometry, number theory, and singularities. A recurring theme in arithmetic geometry is wondering what a `space' really is, and I really like this question -- although Poincar√© had his own thoughts:</p>
    <blockquote>Mon doigt determine un point et c'est cela, et cela seulement, qui definit "un point de l'espace."</blockquote>

    <h3>Teaching</h3>
    <p>At Princeton, I have led <a href="https://www.math.princeton.edu/undergraduate/peer-advisors/directed-reading">directed reading projects</a> for the undergraduate students. I mentored Eliana Du, on Stillwell's book <i>Classical Topology and Combinatorial Group Theory</i>, and Yoyo Xiao, on topics in algebraic number theory.</p>
    <p>As an undergrad at Chicago, I was a TA twice for math 112, a course teaching elementary number theory (and an introduction to proofs) aimed at humanities students. I also volunteered on occasion for the <a href="https://www.mathcirclesofchicago.org">Math Circles of Chicago</a>.</p>
    <p>I was a mentor for the <a href="https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2024/">Chicago REU in 2024</a>. As a student, I participated in the REU three times, and had a blast each time -- thanks to Peter May for organizing it, and <a href="https://niemiro.dev">Matthew Niemiro</a> for making my participation much more pleasant.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>My favorite math textbook is Sally's <i>Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis</i>. My favorite fiction books are <i>The God of Small Things</i> by Arundhati Roy, and <i>The Dream of Scipio</i> by Iain Pears (<i>not</i> the one by Cicero!); I also love the music of Phillip Glass.</p>
    <p>I once tried to understand art history research, and while I never got far, this quote from John Ruskin stuck with me:</p>
    <blockquote>Now -- pardon me for telling you frankly -- you cannot have good architecture merely by asking people's advice on occasion. All good architecture is the expression of national life and character; and it is produced by a prevalent and eager national taste, or desire for beauty.</blockquote>
    <p>I hope that I contribute to the mathematical nation's desire for beauty!</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This website uses vim's <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox">gruvbox</a> color scheme. <a href="https://antonoutkine.com" class="hover-image">Anton Outkine</a> taught me how to add a photo to a webpage (he also taught me more important things...).</p>
