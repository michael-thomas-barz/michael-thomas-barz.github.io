    <h1>The Grothendieck-Katz p-curvature conjecture</h1>
    <p>Thanks to everyone who came to these talks! If you want to learn more, there are some starting points below. Another wonderful reference is Deligne's book <i>Equations Differentielles Ã  Points Singuliers Reguliers
</i>. Although it is written in French, an English translation of it can be found online. Deligne's book covers some wonderful things, but it also assumes a much larger background than I did.</p>
